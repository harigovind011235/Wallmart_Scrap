Python Script To Scrawl Wallmart Pages Using BeautifulSoup

This is a script to scrap webpages using javascript to load their content.

Here i used selenuim and chromedriver to access the JS loaded data you can also check request-html module in python to do the same.

I also provided a Requirements.txt from the virtualenv for this program
